###### About me:
My name is Matt Bozelka and I am currently a developer living in San Jose. I just recently finished a degree in Software Engineering at Cal State Monterey Bay. I also have a degree and experience in Graphic Design.

###### What I can do:
I've been doing front-end dev for the last few years professionally, but I'm also experienced in other areas.
I enjoy working on projects with:

- Javascript
- Node
- Angular
- Python
- Java

###### I'm currently exploring:
Pretty much everything! I am interested in the idea of Javascript in embedded systems, and I would like to get my hands dirty with machine learning.
I often feel like there is too much in too little time! I created this blog to hopefully start documenting things along the way.
